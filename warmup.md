# Warming Up

Before diving into coding, let's have some fun with existing blockchain tools and products first to get a feeling of "using blockchain apps".

First, set up your [MetaMask wallet](https://metamask.io/index.html). For more information, read its [FAQ](https://metamask.io/faqs.html) page.

> Available as a browser extension and as a mobile app, MetaMask equips you with a key vault, secure login, token wallet, and token exchangeâ€”everything you need to manage your digital assets.

Explore inside the intuitive MetaMask wallet, and try to accomplish the following by clicking around:

- Switch to a different network (e.g. switch to Rinkeby testnet).
- Create a new account.
- Change your account name/alias from "Account X" to something you prefer.
- Copy paste your public address (e.g. `0x5238...a1CD`).
- View your _Secret Recovery Phrase_ (but never ever reveal to others or even let it stay in your clipboard for too long, this is your master secret seed).
- View your account on Etherscan.

Now you are ready to try out the following:

- [Sending and receiving ethers](#sending-and-receiving-ethers)
- [exploring blockchain explorer: etherscan](#blockchain-explorer-etherscan)
- [play around ERC20 tokens](#play-around-erc20-tokens)
- [play around ERC721 tokens](#play-around-erc721-tokens)
- [setup alchemy account](#setup-alchemy)

## Sending and receiving ethers

## Blockchain explorer: etherscan

## Play around ERC20 tokens

## Play around ERC721 tokens

## Setup alchemy

[Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) is a powerful developer tool providing features like hosted Ethereum nodes with API access. What that means is: you don't have to run
your own Ethereum node in order to receive updates from or deploy your contacts to the live network, instead you use Alchemy Supernode service as a gateway for a highly
available nodes with a rich set of APIs for your applications to interact with the blockchain.

You can [register here](https://auth.alchemyapi.io/signup), and go through their ['getting started'](https://docs.alchemy.com/alchemy/introduction/getting-started) doc here.

We note that there are alternatives like [Infura](https://infura.io/) that offers similar services, you can use either for your own projects, but we use Alchemy by default in our workshop.
